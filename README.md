# Sentiment Analysis

A sentiment analysis project that predicts whether a movie review is *positive* or *negative* based on its text. The model is built using Python with a small dataset of 1000 IMDB reviews and applies natural language processing (NLP) techniques along with machine learning.

## Introduction

This project implements a sentiment analysis pipeline that:
1. Preprocesses text data (lowercasing, removing special characters, and stopwords).
2. Converts text into numerical features using *CountVectorizer*.
3. Trains a *Logistic Regression* model to classify reviews as positive or negative.
4. Evaluates the model using accuracy and a classification report.

## How to Run

1. *Start Jupyter Notebook*:
   bash
   jupyter notebook
   

2. Open the sentiment_analysis.ipynb file.

3. Execute each cell step by step to:
   - Load and preprocess the dataset.
   - Train the Logistic Regression model.
   - Evaluate the model.
   - Predict sentiment for custom reviews.

## Results

- *Model Accuracy*: ~88% (can vary depending on the dataset and preprocessing).
- Example Sentiment Prediction:
  
  Review: "This movie was absolutely amazing! I loved it."
  Sentiment: Positive
